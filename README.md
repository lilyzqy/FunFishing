## Fun Fishing

Live Game: [Fun Fishing](https://lilyzqy.github.io/FunFishing/)

### Introduction:
This game is inspired by my favorite childhood phone game back in 1990s; the goal is to fish as many and heavy fishes as possible within 30 seconds.

### Game Parameters and Basic Strategies:
There're 2 major parameters in the game:
1. Casting Power: it will decide how far you cast the rod
2. Pulling Power: it will decide how fast you pull the rod

And there're 2 according game strategies:
1. Bigger/heavier fishes are more likely to stay far away from the shore while lighter/smaller fishes are more likely to stay close by the shore
2. The faster you pull the rod, the more likely your fishing string will be broken, which would end up with even more time-wasting

### How to Play:
When game starts, you will select the casting power by pressing ENTER to cast the rod (more power, further you cast) and wait for the fish; when notified there's fish on hook, you need to pull the rod by keep pressing SPACE key, the fish would be either caught when you successfully pull the fish to the shore or escaped when you pull the rod too fast(break the fishline) or too slow.

### Technical Highlights
This game is made of vanilla Java Script. It used DOM to manipulate the html elements and all the animation is achieved by drawing on the html canvas.
